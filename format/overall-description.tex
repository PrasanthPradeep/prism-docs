\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{System Environment}

\hspace{2em}The ShareTaste platform involves three main user roles: Administrator, Users, and Professional Chefs. The Administrator manages and oversees the platform's operations, while Users explore recipes, share their own, and interact with content. Professional Chefs review user-submitted recipes for quality and ensure they meet the platform’s standards.\\

Access to ShareTaste is gated by a login system, which requires users to register by providing a username and password. These credentials are securely stored in a centralized database. Once logged in, users can access various features, such as searching for recipes, filtering by dietary restrictions or excluded ingredients, and submitting new recipes for verification.\\

The backend system leverages a robust NoSQL database to efficiently manage dynamic and unstructured data, including user profiles, recipes, dietary preferences, and search filters. The front-end is implemented using modern web development frameworks to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.
